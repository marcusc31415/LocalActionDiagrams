 A local action diagram <M>\Delta = (\Gamma, (G(v)), (X_a))</M> consists of: 
<List>
<Item>
a directed graph <M>\Gamma</M>, 
</Item>
<Item>
a closed permutation group <M>G(v)</M> for each <M>v \in V(\Gamma)</M>, and 
</Item>
<Item>
a set <M>X_{a}</M> for each <M>a \in A(\Gamma)</M> such that each <M>X_{a}</M> is disjoint and <M>X_{a}</M> is an orbit of the action of <M>G(o(a))</M> on <M>X_{v} := \bigsqcup_{a \in o^{-1}(v)}X_{a}</M>. 
</Item>
</List>

 The definition of digraph used is different to that of the <Package>Digraphs</Package> package. For our purposes, a digraph <M>\Gamma</M> consists of:
<List>
<Item>
a vertex set <M>V</M>,
</Item>
<Item>
an arc set <M>A</M>,
</Item>
<Item>
a map <M>o : A \to V</M> assigning each arc to an <E>origin</E> vertex, and
</Item>
<Item>
a bijection <M>r : A \to A</M> (denoted by <M>a \mapsto \overline{a}</M>) such that <M>r^{2} =  \mathrm{id}</M>. 
</Item>
</List>
 The bijection <M>r</M> defines a reverse arc for each arc of the graph. This is more specific than the definition in the <A>digraphs</A> package which does not require a reverse mapping. 
<P/>
 The local action diagrams package provides a category for local action diagrams. It is built in the <A>IsDigraph</A> category from the <Package>Digraphs</Package> package.
